0.  Color Depth
	JPEG = 2 ^ 24
	BMP = Various
	GIF = 256, 2^8
	PNG = 8 || 24 || 48
	

1.  GIF and PNG allows for animations.

2.  Lossy compression is where you recolour different parts of an image so
it looks the same but you actually change the picture. Lossless is where you 
break the picture into smaller parts which you then put together exactly
as they where before. The difference between lossy and lossless is that lossy
is not the same as it was before it was compressed while lossless is exactly
the same as it was before it was compressed.

3.	JPEG is lossy.
	BMP is NONE.
	GIF is lossLess
	PNG is lossLess

4.  It is moved to the space in the disk where memory which is to be used are.

5.  Either physically destroy the disk or by installing a sanatizing software
which overwrites all my files with trash numbers.

6.  The stdint.h library enables a set width on an integer, for example make an int with 
the decided width of 32 bits or 16 bits.

7.  stdint is useful because it has a set number of bits inside of it instead of the usual 
int size. This allows for more space in the int. 

8.  Byte = 1 byte
	Dword = 4 bytes
	Word = 2 bytes
	Long = 4 bytes
9.  "BM" 42 4D

10. bfSize = Size in bytes of the bmp file.
	biSize = the number of bytes required by the structure.
	

11. biHeight = negative == the bitmap is top down and the origin is in the upper-left 
corner.

12. biBitCount specifies the color depth.

13. If there is no filetype with the infile name.

14. 

15. It should equal to one.

16. It sets the files position indifcator.

17. It tells fseek to start relative to the current  position of the indicator. 

18. Milo Banana dun it.
