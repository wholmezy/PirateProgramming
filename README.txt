A repository for my programs that I make to learn programming. I have a tumblr blog where I post what I learn and what I program.
It is at pirateprogramming.tumblr.com

Who am I?

I am a 18 year old upper secondary school student from Sweden. Recently I have been trying to learn the programming language C. 
I started taking the CS50 Harvard course on the website edX.org on 2014-03-27. 
I am still doing it but taking a break from the course until I learn a bit more about data structures, tries… 
So right now I am doing the Reddit daily programming challenges! Actually I am doing #161 Blackjack right now!
My goal right now is to be able to make small software apps for android. 
I will achieve this goal by doing 10-15 programming challenges in C and then move on to a java course on Udacity which briefly touches android development.
This blog is for me to document my way of thinking and solving bugs and to make it easier to see my progression.
