Pretty proud of this, came up with the pathfinding idea myself, I feel the code is ok for being a pretty hard assignment. Still could be fixed
in multiple ways, I think if I were to rewrite the whole code it would be both smaller and smoother, but that goes with every code
everyone writes so.. **** it! It took 3~ days, I finished it in the night of saturday the 2014-05-31! Almost june!
