Pretty small but clean and fund to program program. I like it. But there is still time for improvement, the array which holds the number of ingredients should be flexible sized.
Found out that my version of Code::Blocks is not up to date with the latest c version... I can not use strcpy_s or scanf_s, which are safer alternatives to strcpy and scanf.
