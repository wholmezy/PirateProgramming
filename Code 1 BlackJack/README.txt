Ugly code, there is a lot of things I can change. For example, I could remove the first deck maker and just have the [520] array mega deck. I think I could 
have had a bit less variables and I could have planned it some more! The program might even not be working correctly. But I did not really enjoy finishing that program. 
I might redo it sometime later.
